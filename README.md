ğŸ‘‹ **Welcome !**

My name is Narimane Dorey (she/her).

ğŸŒŠ I am a researcher in the field of Marine Biology, mostly interested by the impact of humans (climate change, ocean acidification, pollution) on the biology, ecology and reproduction of marine invertebrates.

ğŸŒ± On GitHub, Iâ€™m currently interested in sharing **R** knowledge and improving visualisations and data skills.

ğŸ’¼ I am currently looking for new work opportunities!
